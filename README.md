# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the Project

With a company as large as Pewlett-Hackard, it is incredibly important to track and plan for the number of employees nearing retirement. While it is important to know the number of employees that meet the criteria for retirement, it is equally important to identify current employees that can be mentored over the next few years. This natural attrition will allow for near-future promotions and also free up salary pay for current employees looking to take on more job responsibilites to replace seniored positions as they become available.

### Purpose

Utilizing data collected from various departments, the following analysis is broken down by department to allow for Human Resources and Department Managers to create roadmaps for the next 12-24 months. It will be essential to plan for upcoming retirements, as there are a large number of employees in multiple departments that are eligible for the full retirement package.
